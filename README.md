python3 program to store and manipulate personal contact information for current contacts as
class-objects in Postgresql using SQLAlchemy and Flask. Want to learn python and familiarize myself

following tutorials (and tons of SO answers):
- https://scotch.io/tutorials/authentication-and-authorization-with-flask-login
- https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-crud-application-with-flask-and-sqlalchemy-dm3wv7yu2
